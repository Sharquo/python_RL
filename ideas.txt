Ideas!

With a groan, you wake up on the stone floor of a dusty room.
To your left, there is a small bag.
To your right, there is a neatly written note.

Planned features! (Not in order)
-> Scrolling map
-> Magic system
-> Refactor combat system
-> Inventory and stuff in the terminal?
-> Performance concerns!

Does the schedule really need to be saved with the rest of the game states?  Surely I can just initialise it during gameLoad() and newGame()?
-> Sorted this out for now

How am I going to do the rendering to improve performance?
